-- | This 'Prism' compares for approximate equality with a given value and a predicate for testing,

-- To comply with the 'Prism' laws the arguments you supply to @nearly a p@ are somewhat constrained.
--
-- We assume @p x@ holds iff @x â‰¡ a@. Under that assumption then this is a valid 'Prism'.
--
-- This is useful when working with a type where you can test equality for only a subset of its
-- values, and the prism selects such a value.
